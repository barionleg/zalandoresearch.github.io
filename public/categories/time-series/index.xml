      <description>Time-series forecasting is fundamental to optimal decision making in many scientific and business problems. In the context of time-series forecasting, autoregressive methods are well-suited for their capacity to extrapolate into the future. While classical autoregressive methods model individual time-series independently, recent advances in deep learning methodologies have enabled the use of a single model across multiple time-series. Even though shared parameters in such models allow for detected patterns to be transferred across individual time-series, they fall short when it comes to capturing (potentially higher-order) statistical interdependencies between the time-series.</description>
