      <description>Research Project by Christian Bracher, Sebastian Heinz &amp;amp; Roland Vollgraf Unlike a brick-and-mortar department store, online retailers like Zalando must use digital representations of their offerings to entice customers. Traditionally, this takes the form of information stored in a catalog database, which collects categorical properties (tags), numerical descriptors (e.g., prices), and images of the items. Although this information is curated by in-house experts, assignments are often subjective (what makes a dress ‘dark red,’ or ‘leisure’?</description>

      <description>Research Project by Christian Bracher, Martin Heusel, Sebastian Heinz &amp;amp; Roland Vollgraf Deep learning computer vision models, based on our huge archive of fashion images, already empower various customer-facing AI products at Zalando including recommendations, search, and “complete the look”, a product that generates outfits. We currently face two obstacles in applying our models even further: (1) Models that are trained on Zalando’s highly curated shop imagery don&amp;rsquo;t generalize well to other assortments or customer produced content; and (2) Model performance is tainted by spurious correlations with confounding but irrelevant sources of information inside the Zalando image catalog.</description>

      <description>Research Project by Calvin Seward Caption: Camel in the desert
When I think of robustness, I think of camels*. Camels thrive in unpredictable, varying environments. Be it hot or cold, sunny or windy, dry or rainy camels are prepared with their hump full of fatty deposits, their thick fur and distinctive nose and eyelashes. It would be nice if reinforcement learning methods were like camels, robust and adaptable.
Yet many reinforcements learning methods are quite fragile, and the resulting policies akin to the Devils Hole pupfish, a cute yet sensitive fish whose only habitat is an isolated, water-filled cavern in Nevada.</description>

      <description>Time-series forecasting is fundamental to optimal decision making in many scientific and business problems. In the context of time-series forecasting, autoregressive methods are well-suited for their capacity to extrapolate into the future. While classical autoregressive methods model individual time-series independently, recent advances in deep learning methodologies have enabled the use of a single model across multiple time-series. Even though shared parameters in such models allow for detected patterns to be transferred across individual time-series, they fall short when it comes to capturing (potentially higher-order) statistical interdependencies between the time-series.</description>

      <description>Research Project by Roland Vollgraf SWARM Layers are a new approach to build powerful learnable set functions. These are multi-variate function over a set (or population) of entities that exhibit permutation equivariance or invariance, i.e. these functions are explicitly agnostic to the order of entities. Architecture Building bocks for SWARM Layers are SWARM Cells. These are modified LSTM cells that are augmented with an additional input. Together with the network input x and the previous hidden state h they also receive an input p which resembles pooled information over the whole population.</description>

      <description>Team members:  Gökhan Yildirim Nikolay Jetchev Christian Bracher Sebastian Heinz Martin Heusel Roland Vollgraf  At Zalando, we provide high-quality photographs of fashion models wearing the articles in our online selection. These photographs help our customers visualise the garments they browse and enhance their shopping experience.
But what if our customers wish to visualise an individually created outfit? Zalando provides a large and evolving assortment of garments, which makes it infeasible to photograph every possible outfit combination.</description>

      <description>Research Project by Leonidas Lefakis (ex-member) Chic, shocking, trendy, or casual, Fashion must never be monotonous. As such, diversity plays a central role in fashion. At Zalando we research such topics, focusing on elegant mathematical models named Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) that capture notions of both relevance and diversity in a principled manner.
Defined over a fixed ground set $\Upsilon$, for example the articles in the Zalando catalogue, DPPs define a distribution over subsets of $\Upsilon$.</description>

The dataset was created as part of ongoing research at Zalando into text-image multi-modality in the area of fashion.Unlike other tasks typically encountered in multi-modal learning, in fashion the informative information in the visual data often consists of very fine-grained details that needs to be reflected in the textual descriptions.</description>

And in the future, can we teach them to perform language AI tasks with little training data, across over 20 different human languages? At Zalando Research, we’re investigating answers to these questions.
We are researching a novel approach that leverages neural language modeling to learn powerful, contextualized representations of human language from large corpora.</description>

      <description>Research Project by Abdul-Saboor Sheikh (ex-member) &amp;amp; Urs Bergmann (ex-member) Have you ever wondered what would be the best fitting size of a clothing item that you would like to order online? You may have an idea about the size you generally wear, but this piece of clothing perhaps comes in a different size system or maybe it is a style or category that you have not worn before. Then apart from your own preferences, there may be other factors (such as brand, design, material, manufacturing, etc.</description>

At Zalando, we target an agile design process that combines invaluable human experience with the power of Machine Learning (ML). In particular, we do research on novel ways to use generative models in fashion design for rapid visualizations and prototyping.</description>

Such solutions are widely applicable to a number of Zalando use cases for example demand and trend forecasting or detecting anomalous behaviour.</description>

Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement of the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

      <description>Research Project by Christian Bracher &amp;amp; Sebastian Heinz We study time series of interactions of articles (fashion items) with customers. Our focus lies on personalized data, meaning, that each time series collects data for a single customer only. Examples include the customer’s purchase history as well as their click chain through the product detail pages in the shop. Our aim is to build a method which takes the past of a time series as input and effectively forecasts future events – the task of a recommender system.</description>
