Tofigh Naghibi is currently Head of Zalando AI & Machine Learning Research lab. He received his bachelor and master in electrical engineering from Tehran and Sharif university in Iran and a PhD in machine learning from ETH ZÃ¼rich. After a short postdoc in ETH he joined a startup in Zurich to revolutionize the data preparation world, a dream that took a bit longer than a year. He then joined Zalando as a data scientist and soon realized logistic regression is not all you need. He then became principal scientist in the pricing department where together with colleagues they brought an RL-type pricing system to life. His interests include AI machine learning, computer perception, 3D vision and large scale time-series forecasting.
