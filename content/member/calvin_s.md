Calvin Seward wants to know is that the best we can do? We do search,
but could we do it better. We do recommendations, but could they be 
more engaging? It’s a hard question to answer, since we can’t know for
sure what the customer would have done if she’d been shown different
search / recommendation / pricing results.

Therefore, he’s applying his Mathematics background and strong publication
record in image generation to a three prong-strategy: First, he’s collaborating
with Ingmar Schuster and Kashif Rasul to improve our probabilistic time series
forecasting methods. Then armed with such modeling tools, he is using Thompson
sampling to derive policies which harness past data and explore into the future,
ensuring policies learn and always get better. Such policies which explore have
already been integrated into our outfit generation and recommendation tool.
Finally, to ensure such policies work well in the ever adapting and dynamic fashion world,
he is actively developing methods for robust reinforcement learning algorithms,
generating policies which are proven to work in shifting environments such as the fast paced,
ever changing world that is Zalando.
