We only store and process personal data when you have voluntarily supplied us with it. If we collect any other personal data, you will be informed in this privacy policy or on the respective web pages, of the intended purpose of use and, if necessary, asked for your consent to store and process the data.

Data that you explicitly and knowingly provide to us will be used for the purpose for which we have specified it. The specific purpose will of course be explained to you.


### 2.2 Newsletter


You can sign-up for a newsletter on our website. Before sending the newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in method, i.e. we will only send a newsletter by email if you have explicitly confirmed beforehand that we should activate the newsletter service. Subsequently, we will send you a notification e-mail and ask you to confirm, by clicking on a link contained in the email, that you want to receive our newsletter.

If you no longer want to receive newsletters from us, you can object to the service at any time, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the base rates. A written notice to the address contact details under point 1 (for example, e-mail, fax, letter) is sufficient for this purpose. Of course you can also find an unsubscribe link in every newsletter.


## 3.  Cookies

We use cookies only to make the use of our pages easier for you. Certain pages may store personal data on cookies if you have explicitly agreed to this in advance. In principle, you can also access all the information on our web pages if you have disabled cookies. Should you not accept cookies, this can lead to a limitation of functionality.

## 4.  Log files

During every access of our page user data is transmitted by the respective Internet browser and stored in protocol files, the so-called server log files. The datasets stored here contain the following data: date and time of access, name of accessed page, IP address, referrer URL (original URL from which you arrived at the website), the amount of data transmitted, product and version information of the browser used.

Subject to possible legal retention obligations, users’ IP addresses are deleted or anonymised after use has been ended. During an anonymisation the IP addresses are changed in such a way that the individual information about personal or material circumstances can no longer be allocated to a certain or to an ascertainable person except with an unreasonably high expense of time, money and manpower.

## 5. Web Analysis

In order to constantly improve and optimize our offer we make use of so-called tracking technologies. To this end we make use of the services of Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics makes use of “cookies”, i.e. text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis to be made of our offer by Google. The information recorded by the cookies on the use made of our websites (including your IP address) is normally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We draw your attention to the fact that on our websites Google Analytics were extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” to ensure an anonymized record of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). At our request, your IP address is therefore recorded by Google solely in shortened form, which ensures anonymization and allows no inferences to be made to your identity. In the event that the IP-anonymize function is activated on this website, your IP address will previously be shortened by Google within the member countries of the European Union or in other contracting states that were party to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Google will make use of the said information to evaluate your use of our websites, to prepare reports on the website activities for us and to provide us with further website-related and Internet-related services. The IP address transferred from your browser by Google Analytics is not brought together by Google with other data collected. Any transfer of this data to a third party by Google is made solely on the basis of statutory regulations or within the framework of order data processing. On no account will Google bring your data together with other data recorded by Google.



By using these websites you declare that you consent to the processing of the data collected on you by Google and the previously described manner of data processing, as well as the described purpose.

You can prevent the storage of the cookies by adjusting your browser-software settings appropriately. In this case, however, we draw your attention to the fact that you may not then be fully able to use all of the functions of these websites. You can also prevent the acquisition by Google of the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) as well as its processing by Google in that you download and install the browser plug-in available under the following link:  http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

## 6. Safe data transmission

Your data is transmitted safely by using encryption. Nevertheless, nobody can guarantee absolute protection. However, we secure our website and other systems with technical and organizational measures against the loss, destruction, access, change or dissemination of your data by unauthorized persons.
